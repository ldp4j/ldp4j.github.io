                 <h3 id="abs">Abstract</h3>
                 <p> The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp/" target="_blank">W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP)</a> is an initiative to produce a standard protocol and a set of best practices for the development of read-write Linked Data applications. The LDP protocol provides clarifications on the use of the HTTP protocol in Linked Data applications, proposes several extensions in the context of Linked Data applications, and enforces further restrictions. As consequence, the LDP specification enables interoperable read-write Linked data applications based on HTTP access to web resources that describe their state using the RDF data model. The standardization of this protocol represents a step forward in the Linked Data community as it lays the ground for the development of interoperable read-write Linked Data applications. </p>
                 <p> This tutorial provides an overview to the Linked Data Platform including resources, different types of containers, and other features such as paging, patching, etc., and discusses the different design considerations one should take into account when building read-write Linked Data applications. In addition to the theoretical background on the LDP specification and application design, the tutorial consists of a hands on session on how to build a read-write Linked Data application from scratch using <a href="http://www.ldp4j.org/" target="_blank">LDP4j, an open source Java framework for developing LDP-enabled applications.</a></p>
                 
                 <h3 id="des">Description</h3>
                 <p>Nowadays every organization uses several information systems to manage their information and integrating those applications is a key requirement for efficiently executing the business processes of organizations. Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) techniques, which propose solutions to this problem, have evolved over time from ad-hoc one-to-one integrations to approaches such as Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs), using either SOAP-based or RESTful web services. Application integration using read-write Linked Data is a novel approach that is getting traction in the industry. The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the W3C Linked Data Platform specification and show how this specification and the LDP4j framework can be used to build interoperable read-write Linked Data applications.</p>
                 
                 <p>In concrete, the tutorial will tackle the following questions:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>What are benefits that LDP specification brings in to the Linked Data world?</li>
                     <li>What are different concepts introduced in the LDP specification and their practical usages?</li>
                     <li>What are the design considerations when building read-write Linked Data applications?</li>
                     <li>What is the process to convert legacy applications into read-write Linked Data applications?</li>
                     <li>How to build an interoperable read-write Linked Data application from the scratch using the LDP4j framework?</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>These questions will be answered in a practical way with explanatory examples and will be elaborated in the hands-on exercises in practical sessions.</p>
                 
                 <h3 id="agenda">Agenda</h3>
